# How to start the Visit Counter application:

If nothing has changed in the files:
```
docker-compose up
```

But, if something has changed in the files and you want to see them in the application:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

And if you want to put down all the working containers:
```
docker-compose up down
```

Attention. The command above stops the containers and remove them.
